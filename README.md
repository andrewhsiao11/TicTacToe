## A Tic-Tac-Toe Class

Author: Graham Mitchell

Write a class to handle the basics of a two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The required methods are below. If you've done things correctly, save a copy of the files provided below into the same folder as TicTacToeClass.java and compile and run them to play or test your game.


Instance Variables

- board:	a two-dimensional array of chars
- turns:	an integer keeping track of the number of turns played this game

Constructors

- TicTacToeClass(): the default constructor, which just creates the two-dimensional array and fills each slot with ' ' (a blank space) and initializes the other attributes

Accessors

- boolean isWinner(char p):	returns true if the letter passed in currently has three in a row. That is, isWinner('X') will return true if X has won, and isWinner('O') will return true if O has won
- boolean isFull():	returns true if nine turns have been played and false otherwise
- boolean isCat():	returns true if all nine spaces are filled AND neither X nor O has won
- boolean isValid( int r, int c ):	returns true if the given row and column corresponds to a valid space on the board
- int numTurns():	returns the numbers of turns played so far
- char playerAt( int r, int c ):	returns the character representing the piece at the given location. Should return either ' ', 'X', or 'O'.
- void displayBoard():	displays the current board on the screen
- 
Modifiers

- void playMove(char p, int r, int c):	allows the given player to place their move at the given row and column. The row and column numbers are 0-based, so valid numbers are 0, 1, or 2
 

(...a game already in progress)

	X   O
	O X X
	  X O
 
'O', choose your location (row, column): 0 1

	X O O
	O X X
	  X O
 
'X', choose your location (row, column): 2 0

	X O O
	O X X
	X X O

The game is a tie.
